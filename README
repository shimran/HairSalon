Hairsalon APP

This App is an excercise in database using Postgres. Here a salon owner can view his/her stylists, and see
which clients belong to which stylist. The database for clients includes a phone number to allow easy contact
in case of expansion should stylists move to another location.

Future versions of this database will include email, as well as a log to see how frequently they visit each
stylist. This can lead to better data analytics which in turn can lead to better business strategy.
