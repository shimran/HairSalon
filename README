Hairsalon APP

This App is an excercise in database using Postgres. Here a salon owner can view his/her stylists, and see
which clients belong to which stylist. The database for clients includes a phone number to allow easy contact
in case of expansion should stylists move to another location.

Future versions of this database will include email, as well as a log to see how frequently they visit each
stylist. This can lead to better data analytics which in turn can lead to better business strategy.

Known Bugs:

At this juncture, the client database is causing issue by not saving. Currently the Sinatra app pulls up the
main page, and adds stylists, but does not correspond ids so that the app will be fully functioning.

Once again, this is being attributed by a failure in the .save() method in the Client class.
